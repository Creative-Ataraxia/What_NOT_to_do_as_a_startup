# What NOT to do as a startup
## and Real failed startup stories!


 1. Product-Market Fit  
- Customers don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúpotentially valuable‚Äù products or future promises.  
  - They want solutions to their immediate problems, right NOW.  
- The only early-stage priority:  
  - Validate client pay intentions (product/market fit)  
  - Formula: real pain-point + quantifiable value + crystal clear payer identity.  
- Be cautious of false validation:  
  - Positive early reactions (like on Product Hunt) may just be hype, not real paying customer interest.  
  - Do real user research ‚Äî what you think is mkt demand might be fake.  
- Understand why your target customers would pay, and more importantly, whether they even have money to pay.  
  - Example: college students may love the product but have no purchasing power.  


 2. Founder Psychological Traps  
- Getting funded too early can become a huge psychological trap, impacting day-to-day decision making.
- Don‚Äôt fall for the ‚Äúunicorn founder‚Äù ego trap:  
  - Avoid doing unreasonable (or illegal) things to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the startup.  
- Learn to manage expectations, especially with external partners (developers, marketers).  
- During hard times, cut team sizes instead of faking numbers or raising money to feed ego.  
- Spending marketing budget doesn‚Äôt automatically create fans ‚Äî alignment of values matters.  


 3. Community Engagements
- Google Ads isn‚Äôt the main growth driver. (throwing money at it alone doesn't fix the fundamental issues!)
  - Sustained community engagement is (weekly Zoom calls, community check-ins).  
- Over-hype and early buzz die quickly.  
  - Long-term success depends on maintaining exposure through consistent interaction with your community.  


 4. Customer Acquisition Cost
- Underestimating customer acquisition costs is a killer.  
  - In early stages, over 90% of costs will go into acquiring clients.  
  - Don‚Äôt get surprised by hidden operational costs that make the business untenable.  
- Don‚Äôt market on the wrong platforms.  
  - Example: running X ads to reach Twitch streamers is pointless; they‚Äôre on Discord.  
- Promising ‚Äúfree‚Äù too early is a trap.  
  - Beta phases should have trial payment structures.  


 5. Product Development Mistakes  
- Not building an MVP first and going straight to hiring dev shops to build grand visions wastes money.  
  - Your ‚Äúgenius‚Äù startup idea probably isn‚Äôt so special until proven otherwise.  
- Use process of elimination for features instead of adding more.  
  - The most successful products focus on just a few things done extremely well.  
- User experience is paramount.  
  - If it‚Äôs not foolproof, most users will uninstall the app and never come back.  


 6. Operational Execution  
- Over-reliance on part-time devs and remote workers can lead to founder's ideas not being correctly carried out.  
- Not budgeting founders‚Äô time properly.  
  - Spending too much time fundraising instead of building the product.  
- Missing key hires like a CTO early on can lead to execution chaos down the road. 
- Having a domain-expert consultant on-hand is critical for making informed decisions at every step.  


 7. External Factors  
- Being unable to adapt to external events can sink a startup.  
  - Example: launching a digital detox app right before Apple/Google launched their screen-time features killed momentum.  
- Missing boarder market hype events (like *The Social Dilemma* moment) shows poor strategic timing.  


 8. Cashflow Pitfalls  
- Misaligning payables and receivables timelines destroys cashflow.  
  - Example: paying for ads on day one, billing merchants at day 30, and actually getting paid on day 120 is a recipe for financial disaster.  


 9. Legal Issues  
- Be very cautious with ‚Äúpackaging your startup to look good.‚Äù  
  - This can easily cross into fraud territory (SEC/FBI warning).  
- Faking numbers or financial statements to raise more funding lands you straight in jail.  

 
# Real Failed Startup Stories

1. Data Warehouse Security Product
- Misjudged what customers actually cared about:
	- Customers won't pay for preventive security ‚Äî they pay for tools that helped them pass compliance audits of their own customers (which directly helps increasing sales). 
- The successful competition's core business is automating sales compliance checks.


2. Crypto Payment Portal
- Founder was misled by a initial 3rd party success story (a bakery "Bitcoin for cake" event).  
- The success was due to the bakery‚Äôs local popularity and trendiness ‚Äî not general market demand for crypto payment portals.
- High acquisition costs later on and lack of real customer willingness to pay led to startup failure.  


3. Tinder-for-Shopping App
- Early hype on Product Hunt due to technical novelty, didn‚Äôt translate to real mkt adoption.  
- The app concept didn‚Äôt solve a pain-point; it was like handing out flyers in a mall to ask user to download a directory of the same mall.  
- The pivot to ‚Äútap-on-ad-banner-to-directly-purchase-product‚Äù seemed innovative, but due to the nature of cashflow structure (long revenue cycles, upfront ad costs) caused the founder to commit fraud to raise funding to keep the startup afloat, and he was arrested and convicted of fraud.  


4. Digital Detox App
- Good early publicity but unfortunate timing:
	- Apple and Google launched native screen-time tools right after their launch, killing differentiation.  
- Failed to capitalize on later relevant hype moments (Netflix's *The Social Dilemma*).  
- Burned through $1.1M without ever making any real revenue.
